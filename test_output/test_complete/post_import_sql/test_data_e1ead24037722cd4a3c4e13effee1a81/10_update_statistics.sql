-- Generic Post-Import: Update Statistics
-- This file works for both MySQL and PostgreSQL
-- Generated by CSViper

-- This is a generic SQL file that should be picked up by both engines
-- when no database-specific files are found

-- Generic table analysis (works for both MySQL and PostgreSQL)
-- Note: This is just a placeholder - actual ANALYZE syntax differs between engines
-- but this demonstrates the fallback mechanism

-- Add custom statistics or maintenance queries below as needed
-- Example for MySQL: ANALYZE TABLE REPLACE_ME_DATABASE_NAME.REPLACE_ME_TABLE_NAME;
-- Example for PostgreSQL: ANALYZE REPLACE_ME_DATABASE_NAME.REPLACE_ME_TABLE_NAME;

SELECT 'Generic post-import SQL executed successfully' as status;
