Please read the AI_Instructions/core_design.md to understand the final design of the project. 

We have successfully created the first two stages. The metadata extraction, the generation of the SQL files, and now we need to create the class that generates the go.py file, which is what will actually import the data in the end. 

Look again at ../nppest2/CSVRawImport.py which demonstrated how to build the CREATE TABLE files for the given csv file.
