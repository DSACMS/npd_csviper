Please read the AI_Instructions/core_design.md to understand the final design of the project. 

Then read the ../nppest2/CSVRawImport.py and ../nppest2/import_raw_csv_file.py files which was the previous implementation. 

Then lets complete the first phase described in the core_design.md document. The metadata extractor process.

Lets go a head and implement the Column Name Normalization class now and lets also add a ReadMe.md file that documents (for now) how to run the project from the raw sourcecode rather than from the PyPi package that it will eventually become.

install libraries (like the click library) using pip to confirm they are installed as needed. The terminal already has the venv properly sourced for this purpose. 

Flesh out the standard python PyPi pip-based project files in the repo as needed.
